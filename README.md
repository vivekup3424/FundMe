# Hardhat FundMe Project
###:wave:Hi There,
This project demonstrates a basic blockchain usecase. I have a hardhat app, through which anyone can fund ETH to the deployer and deployer can withdraw funding from the smart contract.

I have used Goerli Testnet, for testing and deployment.
I have used yarn package manager.
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn fund #funds_some_hardcoded_Goerli_ETH
yarn withdraw
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
```
